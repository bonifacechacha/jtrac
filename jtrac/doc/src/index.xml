            This document is a reference guide for <ulink url="http://jtrac.info">JTrac</ulink>
            - the generic issue tracking web-application.  This document is not only a user-guide
            but can also serve as a reference for developers interested in contributing to JTrac.

            This documentation has been generated using the DocBook configuration 
            used by the <ulink url="http://www.springframework.org">Spring</ulink> development team. 
            This particular simplified DocBook helper package was originally developed by Chris Bauer of the
            <ulink url="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</ulink> project.  Thanks go out to all those who
            perfected this very handy approach.

            <title>About</title>
            <para>
                JTrac is a generic issue-tracking web-application that can be easily customized by adding 
                custom fields and drop-downs. Features include customizable workflow, field level permissions, 
                e-mail integration, file attachments and a detailed history view.
            </para>
            <para>
                JTrac was created after the author felt that he could write a much better alternative to a 
                commercial defect tracking tool that he was having to use. Development started in 2004. 
                There have been quite a few releases already and a small but growing base of satisfied users exist 
                who are friends and colleagues of the author. JTrac is ideal for issue tracking but is so generic 
                that you can use it to track well - almost anything.
            </para>
            <para>
                JTrac development used to be hosted at <ulink url="https://jtrac.dev.java.net"/> but moved to SourceForge 
                in early 2006. The older working version was based on Spring JDBC and MS Access and is not being maintained
                any more.  JTrac was completely re-written to use <ulink url="http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</ulink>
                for persistence and the <ulink url="http://www.acegisecurity.org/">Acegi Security</ulink> framework for Spring 
                and it now uses the latest Java 5.0 and JSP 2.0 features.

            <title>Release Notes: Version 2.0-RC2</title>
            <para>
                As the version number implies, 2.0-RC2 is not yet final and thus not recommended for production.
                The intention is to get as much feedback as possible from interested users and there may be
                minor changes to the database schema before the 2.0 milestone.
            </para>
            <para>
                JTrac 2.0 final should be available by the end of August 2006. Development has been slower than 
                expected and the earlier target of June 2006 has admittedly not been met.
            </para>
            <para>
                You are encouraged to try out JTrac and communicate your feedback and interest in future versions
                to the JTrac development team.  Note that you can be up and running with just Java 5 as a prerequisite
                as JTrac comes bundled with a small-footprint web-application server called 
                <ulink url="http://jetty.mortbay.org/">Jetty</ulink>. JTrac also uses an embedded database called 
                <ulink url="http://www.hsqldb.org/">HSQLDB</ulink> by default which makes it extremely easy to evaluate.

                Please see the <link linkend="installation">installation</link> section of this documentation for 
                more details like how you can drop the WAR file into a server of your choice and immediately 
                start using JTrac.

            <para>                    
                JTrac has all the features you would expect from a standard issue-tracking application such as 
                support for file-attachments and e-mail integration.  JTrac offers powerful customization options,
                especially in the areas of workflow and field-level permissions and compares well to even
                commercial tools.

            <title>Easy to Install</title>
            <para>
                One of the useful features of JTrac is that it is distributed with an embedded web-application server 
                (<ulink url="http://jetty.mortbay.org/">Jetty</ulink>) that has a very small footprint.  
                If you have Java 5 installed you can be up and running after downloading and extracting JTrac - by 
                simply using the provided start and stop scripts.  JTrac scans its environment on startup and if a 
                configured database is not detected, <ulink url="http://www.hsqldb.org/">HSQLDB</ulink> is used by 
                default.  Also, if you already have a web-application server that you wish to use (such as 
                <ulink url="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</ulink>) you can drop in just the single WAR file 
                provided and immediately sign on into the application.
            </para>
            <para>
                Please see the <link linkend="installation">installation</link> section of this documentation for 
                more details.  JTrac uses <ulink url="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</ulink> and so it can 
                support any database.

            <para>                    
                JTrac can be used to effectively track various kinds of things such as Bugs, Action Items and Tasks.
                You can easily add the following types of custom fields to a tracker project:
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Drop Down List</para>

            <para>
                Each tracker project that you create can have a different workflow.  JTrac allows for 
                complete customization of the tracker-item lifecycle, right down to the names of
                each intermediate state.  You can even configure whether or not changing of values is
                permitted given the current state within the workflow - and that too at a field-level.

            <title>Custom Roles</title>
            <para>
                JTrac customization does not stop at workflow - you can also define different roles for each tracker
                project that you set up.  This allows for power and flexibility - for example you could define that
                a "DEVELOPER" role can only mark "Assigned" items as "Fixed" and that only a "TESTER" role has the
                power to mark a "Fixed" item as "Closed".  JTrac allows you complete control over the workflow and
                you can easily tweak it to fit your existing process rather than the other way around.
            </para>
            <para>
                Also, field-level permissions can be mapped to roles.  This allows for even more flexibility - for
                example, you can set a project up so that only a "MANAGER" can change the "Severity" level after a
                bug is submitted.
            </para>

        <sect1 id="features-search">
            <title>Search Custom Fields</title>
            <para>
                The intuitive search screen (shown below) allows for easy execution of common queries such as
                find all items "logged by" or "assigned to" a user (or users).  JTrac allows for filtering even
                on custom fields.
            </para>
            <para>
                You can navigate back to the search setup screen from the search results screen and have the
                search parameters still active.  This is useful when trying to tweak complex queries by 
                trial and error.

            <para>
                In addition to be able to search within a single space (project) JTrac allows for searching across
                all (or a sub set of) projects that a user is mapped to.  The "Search All" option appears for users
                that have been mapped to more than one space (project).

                The default view when you log into JTrac is a very handy dashboard view that provides the most 
                frequently used statistics at a glance. You can click on any of the numbers to immediately bring up 
                the search results view listing the items matched. For example, clicking on the count of items 
                "Logged By Me" would immediately display the list of items initiated by the currently logged in user.

                All you require in order to start using JTrac is Java 5.  Only a JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
                is required and not the full-blown JDK (Java Development Kit).

                You can download Java from <ulink url="http://www.java.com/download"/>.  Once you have Java installed
                you can verify that your system is ready to run JTrac by opening a command prompt and typing the
                following command:

            <para>
                If the system responds with a java version that is 1.5 or greater, you are ready to download and run JTrac.

                Once you have Java you can start using JTrac right away because you do not need to configure a web-application 
                server or a database.  JTrac embeds both of these (<ulink url="http://jetty.mortbay.org/">Jetty</ulink> and

                JTrac by default will use a "data" directory that it will automatically create
                within the root (jtrac) folder.  The data directory will contain the files needed by HSQLDB
                (the embedded database) as well as hold uploaded attachments.  The "start.bat" file configures the 
                Jetty server to use port 80 which you can easily change by editing "start.bat".  You may need to do this 
                if for example JTrac does not start because a web-server (like Apache or IIS) is already running on port 80.

            <title>Using only the WAR file</title>
            <para>
                JTrac is designed so that you can be up and running by just deploying the WAR file into your 
                existing web-application server.  Note that you need a servlet 2.4 compliant container.  
                For example, if you have <ulink url="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</ulink> 5.5.X, 
                you can either copy the WAR file into the [tomcat.home]/webapps folder or choose to upload 
                the WAR file through the Tomcat console.
            </para>
            <para>                    
                JTrac saves database information and uploaded attachments into a directory on the server.
                This directory is logically called the "jtrac.home".  When you do a "quick-install" of JTrac
                by just deploying the WAR file, JTrac creates a ".jtrac" folder in the user home folder and
                uses that location as the home directory.

            <para>                    
                To customize the location of "jtrac.home" you have two options.
            </para>
            <para>
                If you can easily set a system property called "jtrac.home" within the environment of your 
                application server then you don't need to edit the WAR file.  Please look at the contents of "start.bat" 
                to see an example of how the appropriate JVM (Java Virtual Machine) parameters can be set when deploying JTrac.  
                For example, if you are using <ulink url="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</ulink> 5.5.X, you can 
                set an environment variable called JAVA_OPTS before invoking the startup script (startup.bat / startup.sh).
                Here is an example for Tomcat 5.5.X on Windows:                
            </para>
            <para>

            </para>
            <para>
                If you explode (unzip) the WAR file, you can edit the /WEB-INF/classes/jtrac-init.properties file
                and customize the location of "jtrac.home".  Note that you can choose to deploy JTrac as an exploded-war 
                and it is not mandatory that you re-package (zip) the WAR file after editing "jtrac-init.properties".
            </para>            
            <para>                    
                You can configure the database that JTrac uses by editing the "jtrac.properties" file that JTrac expects
                within the "jtrac.home" folder.  Note that if JTrac does not find a "jtrac.properties" file in the
                expected location, JTrac creates a fresh one which is pre-configured for HSQLDB.  The contents of this file
                are as follows:

                create the schema if one does not already exist.

                Control Panel :: Administrative Tools :: Services dialog to start the "JTrac-Jetty" service.
                Note that this service is configured to automatically start when Windows starts, by default.

                There are indeed quite a few issue trackers available, both commercial and open source.
                JTrac has flexible workflow capabilities and offers a rare level of control over field-level 
                permissions. JTrac is designed to be able to handle requirements management in the future 
                and this an area where there is a clear lack of open source tools that support
                the needs of agile development teams.

            <para>
                JTrac is also written from the ground up to make use of the very best and latest in Java.  For example
                JTrac is developed using JDK 5.0 features and is targeted at JSP 2.0 and above.

                framework for Spring has been used.  JTrac is effectively a "light-weight" Java EE application and any

                Integration with <ulink url="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</ulink> has already been implemented 
                using the <ulink url="http://tmate.org/svn/">JavaSVN</ulink> library and this will enable effective 
                integration of bug reports with commit history in the future. You can try out the existing experimental 
                support by going to the following url of your JTrac installation: http://[hostname]/jtrac/svn_form.htm

            <para>
                Since JTrac uses the <ulink url="http://www.acegisecurity.org/">Acegi Security</ulink> 
                framework, it would be easy to configure it to use an existing 
                <ulink url="http://www.ja-sig.org/products/cas/">Central Authentication Service</ulink> (CAS) installation 
                for implementing Single Sign On. In fact most of the configuration is in place and only needs to be documented.

            <para>
                JTrac should be able to expose a remote XML API (SOAP or REST) so that core functionality can be 
                invoked / integrated with other systems.
